              <h4><span>></span> Pet Plate</h4>
              <p>
                I was the designer and front-end developer for the initial Pet
                Plate website in 2015 and worked closely with the company as it
                grew over a period of 5 years, eventually becoming Lead
                Front-end Developer. By early 2020, Pet Plate had successfully
                raised a total investment fund of $13 million dollars.

              <p>
                Red Six Media approached me to develop an interactive and smooth
                front-end experience for the LSU - Football Operations Facility
                Expansion. The project required solutions to produce a website
                that matched the detailed designs and interactivity concepts
                provided by Red Six Media whilst remaining fast to use across a
                wide range of devices.

              <h4><span>></span> CSS3 Foundations</h4>
              <p>
                CSS3 Foundations is a book I wrote in 2012 guiding readers
                through the process of using CSS3 features and techniques to
                take a basic website template and turn it into a real-world,
                modern and future proof website. It was published in paperback
                and digital formats by Wiley and later translated to Chinese. It
                was well received with a review score of 4.5 out of 5 on Amazon.

              <p>
                On the Kellogg's Special K - Strong Feeds Strong project I was
                tasked to convert provided designs into a responsive WordPress
                theme with functionality such as multiple languages, galleries,
                hero slider, featured articles, AJAX post loading, and more.

              <h4><span>></span> REMIXED</h4>
              <p>
                REMIXED put their trust in me to develop the digital
                representation of their agency. I produced a website that
                matched the exacting details of the provided designs, was
                performant on many different devices and browsers, and easy to
                update with the latest portfolio items and company information.

              <h4><span>></span> TIGI - Hair Reborn</h4>
              <p>
                Having based their site on a technique I demonstrated in a blog
                tutorial in 2012, TIGI International asked me to develop the
                JavaScript functionality of the TIGI - Hair Reborn website.
                There were a large amount of animations that meant maintaining
                performance was top priority.
