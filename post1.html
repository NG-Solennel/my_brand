          <h1 class="post-title post-left">20 years of experience with CSS</h1>
          <p>
            I've been involved in web development since 2000. Quite possibly my
            favourite tool that I have used for the last 20 years is CSS. It's
            easy to use, lightweight, and achieves an enormous amount. It's the
            written language of design that makes the web look great.

            <br />
            In this post, I take a look at some of the things CSS has helped me
            produce. This post will be included as part of my CSS3 Developer
            portfolio on Toptal.

          <p>
            In 2012 I was having so much fun with CSS3 and wanted to explore it
            at such a deep level that I wrote CSS3 Foundations, published by
            John Wiley & Sons. The book was well received with a review score of
            4.5 out of 5 on Amazon. In writing CSS3 Foundations, it gave me the
            opportunity to question everything I thought I knew about it, and
            check my knowledge against the W3C specs to be absolutely sure I
            knew what I was writing was correct. Despite feeling I knew enough
            to write a book on the topic of CSS3, in doing so, you learn more
            than you might expect and really start to understand your chosen
            subject at a deep level. CSS3 Foundations still has a proud place on
            my bookshelf today, as well as a version translated into Chinese!
            <br /><br />

            <b>2006 - 2012</b> <br />
            In my opinion, this period was quite possibly the most exciting for
            CSS. It seemed like CSS was starting to support the features that
            designers and developers wanted, rather than designers and
            developers having to work to what was available. We got features
            such as custom fonts, transforms, transitions, keyframe animation,
            media queries, and more! <br /><br />

            <b> 2000 - 2006</b> <br />
            When I first started using CSS, it was fun and you could achieve a
            great deal but at the same time, you often felt limited. Layout was
            generally done via HTML tables but the extensibility of CSS meant
            that developers were able to find ways to hack better layouts -- by
            using floats and clearfix hacks for example. Although hacks such as
            these allowed for achieving things that CSS wasn't necessarily built
            for, they demonstrated that it could achieve beyond its means when
            put in the right hands. <br />
            <br />
            <b> Conclusion </b><br />
            CSS is often one of those tools that doesn't really get the
            attention it deserves but I believe that is because, despite some
            shortcomings, it does such a great job we tend not to think about
            it. If good design is invisible, then CSS is the invisible tool that
            makes good design possible on the web.
